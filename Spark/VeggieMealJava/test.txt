Apache Spark is an open source data processing framework which can perform analytic operations on Big Data in a distributed environment. It was an academic project in UC Berkley and was initially started by Matei Zaharia at UC Berkeleyâ€™s AMPLab in 2009. Apache Spark was created on top of a cluster management tool known as Mesos. This was later modified and upgraded so that it can work in a cluster based environment with distributed processing.
